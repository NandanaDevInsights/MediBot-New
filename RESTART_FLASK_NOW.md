# 🔴 CRITICAL: You MUST Restart Flask Server!

## THE PROBLEM IS SIMPLE

You updated your `.env` file with new Twilio credentials, but **your Flask server is still running with the OLD credentials loaded in memory!**

The `.env` file is ONLY loaded when the server STARTS. Changes to `.env` have NO EFFECT until you restart.

---

## **THE FIX (30 SECONDS)**

### Step 1: Stop Flask Server
In your Flask terminal, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: Restart Flask Server
In the same terminal, run:
```powershell
python app.py
```

### Step 3: Test It Works
Run the diagnostic:
```powershell
python diagnose.py
```

This will show you if everything is working.

### Step 4: Send Test Image
Send a prescription image via WhatsApp.

## **WHAT YOU'LL SEE (If Working)**

In your **Flask terminal**, you'll see detailed logs like:

```
================================================================================
[INFO] WEBHOOK HIT - Processing WhatsApp Message
[INFO] Timestamp: 2026-01-21 10:10:30.123456
================================================================================

```

And you'll get a **reply on WhatsApp**!

## **QUICK CHECKLIST**

Before testing, make sure:

- [ ] `.env` file has correct Twilio credentials (Account SID and Auth Token)
- [ ] Flask server was **RESTARTED** after updating `.env` (THIS IS CRITICAL!)
- [ ] ngrok is running (`ngrok http 5000`)
- [ ] Twilio webhook URL is configured (your ngrok URL + `/webhook/whatsapp`)
- [ ] You've run `python diagnose.py` and all tests passed

---

## **DIAGNOSTIC COMMAND**

After restarting Flask, run this to verify everything:

```powershell
python diagnose.py
```

This will test:
- ✅ Twilio credentials are valid
- ✅ Flask server is running
- ✅ Webhook endpoint is accessible
- ✅ ngrok tunnel is active
- ✅ Database is working

And tell you exactly what to fix if something is wrong.

## **COMMON MISTAKES**

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Restarting Flask
**Problem:** Updated `.env` but didn't restart Flask
**Fix:** Always press Ctrl+C and run `python app.py` after changing `.env`

### ❌ Mistake #2: Wrong Terminal
**Problem:** Restarted the wrong terminal
**Fix:** Restart the terminal running `python app.py`, NOT the ngrok terminal

### ❌ Mistake #3: Old Credentials Still in Memory
**Problem:** Flask loaded old credentials at startup
**Fix:** Stop Flask completely, verify `.env` is saved, then restart

---

## **STILL NOT WORKING?**

### If you see 401 error in logs:
1. Verify credentials in `.env` are correct (copy them fresh from Twilio)
2. **RESTART Flask server**
3. Run `python test_current_credentials.py` to verify they work
4. If test passes but Flask still fails, Flask isn't reading the new credentials

### If you see no logs at all:
1. Check ngrok is running
2. Verify Twilio webhook URL matches your ngrok URL
3. Make sure webhook URL ends with `/webhook/whatsapp`
4. Check Twilio webhook is set to POST method

### If download fails with different error:
Run diagnostic script for detailed analysis:
```powershell
python diagnose.py
```

---

## **FINAL STEPS (DO THIS NOW)**

```powershell
# 1. Stop Flask (in Flask terminal)
Ctrl + C

# 2. Verify your .env has these lines (with YOUR credentials):
# TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
# TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

# 3. Restart Flask
python app.py

# 4. Run diagnostic
python diagnose.py

# 5. If all tests pass, send test image via WhatsApp
```

**The issue is NOT the code. The code is fixed. You just need to restart Flask so it loads the new credentials!**
