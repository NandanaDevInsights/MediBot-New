# 🎯 FINAL FIX - Run This Way

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

You have **2 Flask instances running** at the same time! That's causing conflicts.

Also, Flask auto-reload is **NOT reloading environment variables** from `.env` when files change.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION (Follow These Steps EXACTLY)

### Step 1: Stop ALL Flask Instances

Go to **BOTH** your Flask terminals and press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

Or run this script to kill all Python processes:
```powershell
python kill_and_restart.py
```

### Step 2: Verify .env File

Make sure your `.env` has the correct credentials:
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
```

### Step 3: Start Fresh with OCR.py

In **ONE terminal only**, run:
```powershell
python OCR.py
```

You should see:
```
================================================================================
        🚀 Starting MediBot Server (OCR + WhatsApp Integrated)
================================================================================

✅ Twilio Account SID: YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
✅ Twilio Auth Token: YOUR_TWILIO...TOKEN

================================================================================
   Server running on: http://localhost:5000
   Webhook endpoint: http://localhost:5000/webhook/whatsapp
================================================================================

📡 Ready to receive WhatsApp messages!

 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**✅ If you see your Account SID and Auth Token displayed, it's working!**

### Step 4: Send Test Image

Send a prescription image via WhatsApp.

You should see in the terminal:
```
================================================================================
[INFO] WEBHOOK HIT - Processing WhatsApp Message
[INFO] Timestamp: 2026-01-21 10:15:30
================================================================================
[INFO] Sender: whatsapp:+919847458290
[INFO] Number of media: 1
[INFO] Media URL: https://api.twilio.com/...
[INFO] Will save to: c:\Users\...\static\prescriptions\rx_...
[DEBUG] Using credentials:
[DEBUG]   Account SID: YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
[DEBUG]   Auth Token: YOUR_TWILIO...TOKEN
[DEBUG] Attempting download...
[DEBUG] Download response status: 200
[INFO] Image downloaded: static/prescriptions/rx_1737443123_abc123.jpg
```

---

## 🔍 VERIFY IT'S WORKING

### Check #1: Startup Log
When you run `python OCR.py`, you should see:
- ✅ Your Twilio Account SID displayed
- ✅ Your Auth Token (first 8 chars and last 4 chars)

If you **don't** see your credentials, the `.env` file is not being loaded!

### Check #2: Webhook Hit
When you send an image, you should see:
- ✅ `[INFO] WEBHOOK HIT - Processing WhatsApp Message`
- ✅ `[INFO] Sender: whatsapp:+919847458290`
- ✅ `[DEBUG] Download response status: 200`

If you see `401`, credentials are wrong.
If you see nothing, ngrok/Twilio webhook is not configured.

---

## 📋 COMPLETE CHECKLIST

Before sending test image:

- [ ] **Stopped ALL Flask instances** (check both terminals, or run kill script)
- [ ] **Verified .env file** has correct Twilio credentials
- [ ] **Started server with `python OCR.py`** (only ONE instance)
- [ ] **Saw credentials displayed** on startup
- [ ] **ngrok is running** in separate terminal (`ngrok http 5000`)
- [ ] **Twilio webhook configured** with ngrok URL + `/webhook/whatsapp`

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

### Mistake #1: Multiple Flask Instances
**Problem:** Running both `python app.py` AND `python OCR.py`  
**Fix:** Run ONLY `python OCR.py`

### Mistake #2: Not Killing Old Instances
**Problem:** Old Flask processes still running with old credentials  
**Fix:** Run `python kill_and_restart.py` or manually stop all

### Mistake #3: Credentials Not Showing
**Problem:** If startup doesn't show your credentials, `.env` isn't loading  
**Fix:** Check `.env` file exists in same directory as OCR.py

---

## 🚀 QUICK START COMMANDS

```powershell
# 1. Stop everything
python kill_and_restart.py

# 2. Start OCR server
python OCR.py

# 3. In another terminal, start ngrok
ngrok http 5000

# 4. Send test image via WhatsApp
```

---

## 📊 EXPECTED VS ACTUAL

### ✅ CORRECT (What You Should See):

**Startup:**
```
🚀 Starting MediBot Server (OCR + WhatsApp Integrated)
✅ Twilio Account SID: YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
✅ Twilio Auth Token: YOUR_TWILIO...TOKEN
📡 Ready to receive WhatsApp messages!
```

**When Image Sent:**
```
[INFO] WEBHOOK HIT - Processing WhatsApp Message
[DEBUG] Download response status: 200
[INFO] Image downloaded
```

### ❌ WRONG (What Indicates Problems):

**If you see:**
- No credentials on startup → `.env` not loading
- Multiple "Restarting with stat" messages → Multiple instances running
- No webhook logs → ngrok/Twilio not configured
- `401` error → Credentials invalid or server using old credentials

---

## 🆘 STILL NOT WORKING?

Run diagnostic:
```powershell
python diagnose.py
```

This will tell you EXACTLY what's wrong.

---

## ✅ SUMMARY

1. **Stop all Flask** (kill_and_restart.py or Ctrl+C)
2. **Run `python OCR.py`** (verify credentials shown)
3. **Ensure ngrok running** (ngrok http 5000)
4. **Send test image**
5. **Watch terminal** for logs

**That's it!** The code is already fixed. You just need to start it fresh with the new credentials loaded.
